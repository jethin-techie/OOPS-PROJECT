# OOPS-PROJECT
A lightweight, educational digital twin of an EV powertrain implemented in Python. The project models the battery, motor (PMSM), inverter and transmission, composes them into an EVPowertrain that can be stepped through a simple drive cycle, and produces plots + a PDF simulation report.
